          question: "How is content creation ROI calculated?",
          answer: "Content creation ROI is calculated by dividing the revenue generated (from ads, sponsorships, affiliate marketing, etc.) by the time investment (content creation, editing, promotion). This calculator factors in platform-specific monetization rates and the time value of your effort."
        },
        {
          question: "What's considered a good hourly rate for content creators?",
          answer: "Hourly rates vary widely by niche, experience, and platform. New creators often earn $5-15/hour, mid-tier creators $15-50/hour, and established creators with large audiences can earn $50-500+/hour. This calculator helps benchmark your current earnings against your time investment."
        },
        {
          question: "Which platform offers the best monetization potential?",
          answer: "YouTube typically offers the highest ad revenue rates, especially for niches like finance and tech. However, Instagram and TikTok often provide better sponsorship opportunities. The best platform depends on your content type, audience demographics, and monetization strategy."
        },
        {
          question: "How can I improve my content creation ROI?",
          answer: "To improve ROI: 1) Reduce production time without sacrificing quality, 2) Repurpose content across multiple platforms, 3) Focus on higher-CPM niches or sponsored content, 4) Build systems and templates to streamline creation, and 5) Scale successful content formats rather than constantly creating new ones."
